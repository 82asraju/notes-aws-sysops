# Notes - AWS SysOps Administrator Associate (SOA-C01) #
__________________________________________________

It's been five months since I passed the **AWS Solutions Architect** exam and I have learned and used a lot of other technologies beyond the realms of AWS.

This also meant I have briefly stayed away from AWS for almost half a year to focus on other stuff such as re-learning Python, diving into Ansible, exploring Google Cloud, and also exposing myself more to tools being used at work.

You might be saying I've been spreading myself a little thin, but I do believe that to be a Cloud Engineer, you must have an idea on some of these technologies, at least at a superficial level.

I know there's only a handful that I can truly focus on at a time, which is why I have tried to limit myself in learning only the minimum core pre-requisites:

- Linux
- Python
- Git
- At least 1 IaC tool - Ansible
- At least 1 public cloud - AWS
- a bit of Docker and Kubernetes

Yeah I know, that's still a lot. I'm still in progress on learning some of these stuff. AWS Itself is an entire *universe* of learnings and I've been lucky to have learned about it and fortunately, bagged the Practitioner and Architect certification last year.

So this year, I'm targeting the two remaining Associate certifications. And I'll be starting off with the **AWS SysOps Administrator**.

I'm giving myself two months to study and take the exam. I'll put here the notes and projects that I'll be working on while reviewing.

As for the review materials, I'll also be focusing myself on these materials:

- [Ultimate AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/) by Stephane Maarek

- [[NEW] AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-training/) by Neal Davis

- [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Practice Exams 2021](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-practice-exams/) by Tutorials Dojo

- Official AWS Documentation

Okay, so it's currently 27-Jan-2021 and hopefully I'll get to update this by March 2021 and post the certificate below.

Alright. Full steam ahead.

**UPDATE - 11-Feb-2021**

I have finished Stephane Maarek's SysOps course. I had a 4 day downtime during the first few days because I had to focus on some stuff at work. I was able to focus at an intense pace during my 10-day leave.

**Experience so far:** 
As always, Stephane's method doesn't disappoint but I would say that you really have to have taken the AWS Solutions Architect exam or at least have some background on some of the ins and outs of Amazon Web Services as I find SysOps somewhat an continuation - what follows after you've built the whole setup as a Cloud Architect.

Having a prior extensive study in AWS also helped a lot in the speedy review, I would say. There were still some new topics or rather, some topics that were further explored in the SysOps review.

**What comes next:** 
Important stuff came up at work, have to study Containers and also explore more about Kafka so I'll give time on those first. The funny thing is, Stephane's also has some resources for Kafka, so I'll probably be continue sitting in at some of his materials for Kafka.

On the side, I'll start with Neal Davis's two free practice test in his SysOps course. The plan is:

- **First round:** Finish Stephane's SysOps course
- **Checkpoint:** Take practice test on Neal' SysOps course
- **Second Round:** Go over the actual Davis' SysOps course
- **Final Round:** Tutorial Dojo's Intensive SysOps Practice Tests

Of course, I don't expect everything to be as flawless. 
I know work and life may butt in from time to time, but I'll try to hopefully stick with this plan.

Alright. Hope you ready for the next episode.
